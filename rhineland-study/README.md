# Rhineland Study MRI Protocols

## native

Protocol running in the study centers in Bonn, Germany, since 2016 only with sporadic, required sequence updates

2023-12-13:
* add rhineland_v3p1_FU1_Hippo.pdf and rhineland_v3p1_FU1.exar1 as native.pdf and native.exar1, respectively
* note: native.exar1 includes - besides rhineland_v3p1_FU1_Hippo - rhineland_v3p1_FU1_QSM and rhineland_v3p1_FU1_T1_QSM programs (with different scans in the free protocol)

## updated

Corresponding protocol with some custom sequences (used in the native protocol) replaced by recently updated (and potentially bug-fixed) custom sequences

## compatible

Corresponding protocol recreated for "weaker" MRI scanners than the MAGNETOM Prisma, specifically tested for the MAGNETOM Skyra

2023-12-13:
* add RLS_extern_Skyra_2023.pdf and RLS_extern_Skyra_2023.exar1 as compatible.pdf and compatible.exar1, respectively
